<h2> Permutation patterns &amp; python. </h2>

    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p>
    My research so far has been focused on the combinatorics of relational structures.
    I am currently studying for a PhD at the University of Otago under the supervision
    of Michael Albert. My current area of particular interest is the examination of
    how easy it is to create new occurrences of a given substructure.
    </p>
    <p>
    During my M.Sc.
    studies at Reykjavik University I had the opportunity to work with world-class researchers
    in the field. I was been a member of the informal research group coined
    <a href="https://ulfarsson.github.io/permuta_triangle/main_page.html">{{'"The Permuta Triangle"' | smartify}}</a>.
    My M.Sc. project was an extension of previous research of my supervisor.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have helped in development of tools and methods for assistance in the
    enumeration of permutation classes. This work was being conducted using python and
    a library for use in the exploration of permutation pattern related problems is in development.
    </p>
    <p>
    My personal interests in research that I would like to pursue further include exploring links
    between Automata Theory and Combinatorics; coincidence between sets of combinatorial structures
    when considered with some substructure restrictions; and the applications of coding to combinatorial
    objects (in particular how they capture statistics on such objects).
    </p>
    <p>
    More generally I have an interest in complexity theory, language and automata theory, the
    use of computers in tackling problems in discrete mathematics, and the use of computers in the
    teaching of mathematics.
