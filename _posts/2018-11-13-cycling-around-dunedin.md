In the last month or so I have gotten into road cycling. It started with
purchasing a 1994 GT Force chromoly Road Bike from a friend who was leaving
the country for NZ$80. It was in reasonably good condition but some things
needed a little attention, everything on the bike seemed to be the original
components. The pedals that came with it were old track pedals with straps and
metal toe-clips---at least it should have had toe-clips ,they had snapped off at
some point in the past---so I replaced them with Shimano SPD pedals, and got
accompanying shoes on a clearance offer at one of the local bike stores. The
wheels were the original Mavic 195, with Continental Super Sport Ultra tyres
attached---the inner tubes had attached themselves to both the tyre and the
rim---my friend had a set of FSA wheels and some Continental GP Attack and Force
tyres that we fitted at the local community bike shop
[_The Crooked Spoke_][crookedspoke] since owning a chain whip and cassette
lockring tool is a luxury not afforded to poor PhD students. With these
replacements and some minor adjustments to cabling my foray into cycling could
begin.

Now for some minor geography, Dunedin, where I am currently living, sits at the
end of Otago harbour, a 21km long natural harbour, formed from drowned shield
volcano remnants, leading to the Pacific Ocean.
The city itself is mostly nestled in between a lower ring of hills about 200m
high and the harbour and Pacific ocean, slightly further inland there is a ring
of hills that form the remnants of the volcanic crater that forms the harbour.

As an unfit cyclist I began with a nice easy cycle to St Leonards almost 16km
mostly along a shared pedestrian and cycle path that runs along the western side
of Otago Harbour, the ride is relatively flat with a total ascent of 44m. After
the 43 minute ride I felt like my inner tube wasn't the only thing that was
burst---I need to be more gentle when pulling over the kerb--yet I decided I
would keep trying, I set myself a goal of completing the ride in 35 minutes.

I did this ride twice again over the following two weeks, with baggy shorts and
a floppy old t-shirt. I decided to buy some more suitable cycling attire,
a pair of shorts (with chamois to cushion my posterior) and a luminous yellow
cycling jersey with plenty of pockets to carry things that I previously had to
awkwardly stuff into my saddle bag.

The following day the sun was splitting the sky and I convinced my friend Jason,
who had been with me on the previous rides, to take a trip out along Portobello
road along the eastern side of the Harbour, and out onto the Otago Peninsula.
I had no idea how long it would take, since I had only looked at the weather.
Almost an hour and 21km later we were sat outside the Penguin Caf√© in Portobello
having a coffee, with sore arms after a long section of road that is under repair.
We then set off up Highcliff Road, which has a section of 15% gradient,
only to find that the road was closed further up the hill due to
half of the road being halfway down the hillside. The total ride that day was
just shy of 50km, a new record for me, and a great sense of accomplishment
accompanied this.

After the pain that was climbing Highcliff road I set my sights on getting up
hills more effectively. North Road seemed like the perfect battlegrounds, a
3.3km hill with 242m of elevation, giving a nice "leisurely" 7% gradient. The
first couple of times up that hill were a true grind, running 53/42 chainrings
and a 11-22 cassette makes hills painful. After this another trip to
[_The Crooked Spoke_][crookedspoke] made the climbs a little easier with a
11-26 cassette. Climbing with Jason is also interesting since he weighs 50-60kg,
compared to my solid 95kg (He finds it a little easier going, especially with
his compact cranks).

Another one of the milestone rides was a trip out to Aramoana, a township right
at the mouth of the harbour, this was a beautiful ride along the side of the
harbour for just over 25km each way, giving the first--and as of yet only---50km
I have completed.

This was closely followed by my first ride with 500m+ of elevation, a loop
up North Road, past Mount Cargill Scenic Reserve, past Orokonui Ecosanctury and
then back along the road from Port Chalmers, with a small gravel climb thrown
in just for fun (it's interesting when your gps unit gives the road name as
"Unpaved Road").

I hope to keep cycling and exploring more of the area around Dunedin on
the bike, perhaps going further afield as well. I hope at some point to ride the
Central Otago Rail trail, but that needs a few more logistical challenges to
overcome (i.e. My 1994 road bike with 23mm tyres is not particularly suited for
long gravel rides). I also hope to put in a 100km+ _Tour de Dunedin_[^1] covering
the entirety of the harbour basin, riding to Aramoana and then to the Albatross
Centre at Taiaroa Head with over 1000m ascent. If you want to follow my exploits
head over to my [Strava][strava] page. I'll also try to update here for any big
milestones or adventures.
